# Simple Payment Setup for SessionMailer

This is a **much simpler** approach than the complex PayPal integration. Users pay you directly and you manually approve their access.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **User signs up** → Sees payment wall
2. **User pays** via PayPal, Venmo, or direct transfer to `walterjonesjr@gmail.com`
3. **User submits** payment confirmation details
4. **You verify** the payment in your PayPal/Venmo account
5. **You approve** their access via admin dashboard
6. **User gets access** to SessionMailer dashboard

## 🚀 **Setup Steps**

### 1. Run the Simple Database Migration

In your Supabase SQL Editor, run this simple migration:

```sql
-- Copy and paste contents of simple-payment-migration.sql
```

### 2. Deploy to Fly.io

No environment variables needed! Just deploy:

```bash
fly deploy
```

### 3. Create Your PayPal Subscription Button (Optional)

1. Go to [PayPal Button Generator](https://www.paypal.com/buttons/)
2. Choose "Subscription"
3. Set:
   - Amount: $10.00
   - Billing cycle: Monthly
   - Business email: walterjonesjr@gmail.com
4. Copy the button ID and update the component (optional)

## 💰 **Payment Methods Available**

### For Users:
1. **PayPal Subscription** - Automatic monthly billing
2. **Venmo** - One-time $10 payments (manual monthly)
3. **Direct PayPal** - Send money to walterjonesjr@gmail.com

### For You:
- All payments go directly to your accounts

2. **Go to `/admin/payments`** in SessionMailer
3. **Match payments** with user confirmation details
